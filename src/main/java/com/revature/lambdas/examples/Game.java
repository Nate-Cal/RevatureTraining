/**
 * Lambdas filling the standard function-type slots (Predicate, Comparator,
 * Consumer, UnaryOperator) against a real collection.
 *
 * A Predicate is a function that tests a value and returns a boolean, so it
 * is the natural fit for deciding what to keep or drop.
 *
 * A Comparator is a two-argument function that returns a negative, zero, or
 * positive number, which is exactly what an ordering algorithm needs.
 *
 * A Consumer is a function that takes a value, returns nothing, and is used
 * for side effects such as printing.
 *
 * A UnaryOperator is a function that takes one value and returns another of
 * the same type, which is how a whole collection can be mapped in place.
