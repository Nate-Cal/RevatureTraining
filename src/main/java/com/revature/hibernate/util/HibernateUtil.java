/**
 * HibernateUtil
 * =============
 * A small helper class whose only job is to build and hold the application's
 * single Sessionfactory.
 *
 * Why do we need this? SessionFactory is expensive to create
 * (it parses mappings, validates the config, connects to the DB, etc.),
 * so we should build it exactly once and reuse it for the whole lifetime of the
 * application. This class implements the singleton pattern around it.
 *
 * Configuration source: this class reads hibernate.properties
 * from the classpath. Hibernate automatically loads a file with that exact name
 * when a Configuration is created. Notice we do not call configure() because
 * doing so would load hibernate.cfg.xml instead. We instead keep the properties file
 * as our single source of truth (see the comment block in hibernate.cfg.xml)
