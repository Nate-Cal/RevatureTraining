/**
 * InheritanceDemo
 * ===============
 * Demonstrates how Hibernate maps a Java inheritance hierarchy to tables
 * This project uses the SINGLE TABLE strategy, the
 * default and simplest option.
 *
 * Recall the problem: relational databases have no concept of inheritance.
 * So when we have an abstract Payment base class with two concrete subclasses
 * (CreditCardPayment and CashPayment), Hibernate has to pick a way to lay
 * those Java classes out as tables. With Single Table inheritance, ALL of
 * them share ONE table named "payments", and a discriminator column
 * (payment_type) records which class each row belongs to.
 *
 * This demo:
 *   1. Persists one CreditCardPayment and one CashPayment into the SAME table.
 *   2. Queries them back polymorphically (through the base type), showing that
 *      both subclass rows are returned from a single "from Payment" query.
 *   3. Uses type(p) to filter the hierarchy by concrete class.
 *
 * To explore the other two strategies (Joined Table / Table Per Class), edit
 * the @Inheritance annotation on Payment.java as described in its comments and
 * re-run -- watch how the generated tables change.
