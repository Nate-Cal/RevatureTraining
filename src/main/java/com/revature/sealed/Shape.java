 *
 * Each permitted subclass must pick one of three options:
 *
 *   Circle      final       -- the hierarchy stops here
 *   Rectangle   sealed      -- carries the restriction onward, permitting Square
 *   Triangle    non-sealed  -- lifts the restriction; anyone may extend it again
 *
 * Shape itself stays abstract, so the only way to get a Shape is one of these.
