/**
 * Lazy, thread-safe singleton via the Initialization-on-Demand Holder idiom.
 *
 * The nested holder class is not touched until getInstance() reads
 * Holder.INSTANCE, so the asset manager is only built on first use —
 * a match that never loads an asset should never build it.
 *
 * Because the JVM class loader initializes a class exactly once, no one can
 * see the holder half-built and no synchronized is needed. This is the
 * standard way to get laziness and thread safety together.
