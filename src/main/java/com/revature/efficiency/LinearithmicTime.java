/**
 * O(n log n) — linearithmic time. Work grows as n times the log of n, which is
 * the best any comparison-based sort can do in the worst case.
 *
 * The easy approach is Arrays.sort, which hides the algorithm (Java uses
 * TimSort). To see what happens under the hood, a merge sort implementation is
 * included. Merge sort is O(n log n) because it does O(n) work per "level" of
 * its recursion, and there are about log2(n) levels.
 *
 * See merge-sort.md for a step-by-step walkthrough.
