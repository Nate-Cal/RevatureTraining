/**
 * O(n!) — factorial time. Growth is faster than exponential and becomes
 * unusable almost immediately.
 *
 * Enumerating every permutation of n values is the canonical example: there
 * are exactly n! permutations (1, 2, 6, 24, 120, ...). The runtime is so steep
 * that moving from n=7 to n=8 multiplies the work by 8, and any real input
 * larger than about 10 is effectively impossible.
 *
 * The recursion below builds a permutation slot by slot, remembers which values
 * are already used, and counts every complete arrangement.
 *
 * See factorial-permutations.md for a visual walkthrough.
