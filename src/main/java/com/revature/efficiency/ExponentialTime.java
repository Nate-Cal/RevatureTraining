/**
 * O(2^n) — exponential time. Each increment of n roughly doubles the work.
 *
 * Naive recursive Fibonacci is the classic example. To compute fib(n), the code
 * asks for fib(n-1) and fib(n-2); each of those asks for two more, and so on,
 * so the number of calls grows like 2^n. Notice the answer itself stays tiny
 * (fib(20) is only 6,765) — the work explodes even though the result does not.
 *
 * That is precisely why memoization (caching subproblem answers) exists: with
 * caching, this same computation collapses from ~2^n calls down to n.
 *
 * See naive-fibonacci.md for a visual walkthrough.
