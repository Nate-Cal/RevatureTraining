/**
 * O(n^2) — quadratic time. Work grows as the square of the input size.
 *
 * Bubble sort is the canonical example. Its two nested loops compare pairs
 * over and over. The outer loop runs n-1 passes while the inner loop compares
 * a shrinking window, which adds up to roughly n^2/2 comparisons. That is far
 * too slow for large inputs.
 *
 * There is no standard-library O(n^2) sort to lean on, because Java's built-in
 * sorts are all faster (O(n log n)) — so here the hand-written version IS the
 * demonstration.
 *
 * See bubble-sort.md for a step-by-step walkthrough.
