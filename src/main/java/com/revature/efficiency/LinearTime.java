/**
 * O(n) — linear time. Work grows in exact proportion to the input size.
 *
 * Linear search is the canonical example. It checks elements one by one from
 * the start until it finds the target, so in the worst case (target absent, or
 * sitting at the far end) it examines all n elements.
 *
 * Compare this to LogarithmicTime: both search for a value, but linear search
 * is O(n) while binary search is O(log n). That difference is the whole story
 * of why the sorted-array precondition on binary search is worth paying for.
 *
 * See linear-search.md for a step-by-step walkthrough.
