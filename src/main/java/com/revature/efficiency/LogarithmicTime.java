/**
 * O(log n) — logarithmic time. With every step the amount of remaining work is
 * halved, so it rises only as fast as the base-2 logarithm of the input size.
 *
 * Binary search is the canonical example. It only works on a sorted array. It
 * compares the target against the middle element, then discards the half of
 * the array the target cannot be in, and repeats on what remains. Because each
 * comparison halves the search space, an array of n elements needs at most
 * about log2(n) comparisons.
 *
 * See binary-search.md for a step-by-step walkthrough.
