/**
 * A classic deadlock: two threads each hold one lock and wait forever for the
 * other's. Thread 1 grabs LOCK_A then wants LOCK_B; thread 2 grabs LOCK_B then
 * wants LOCK_A. Neither can proceed, and the program hangs by design.
 *
 * A lock (here an intrinsic/synchronized lock, taken with the synchronized
 * keyword) gives a thread exclusive access to the block it guards. Only one
 * thread may hold a given lock at a time, and any other thread that tries to
 * enter a synchronized block on the same lock blocks until it is released.
 *
 * Note a deadlock does not crash — it just quietly stops making progress, which
 * is why it is so hard to debug.
