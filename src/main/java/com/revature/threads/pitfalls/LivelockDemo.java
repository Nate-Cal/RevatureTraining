/**
 * Livelock: neither thread is BLOCKED, both stay RUNNABLE and busy, yet
 * neither makes progress. Each worker permanently holds its own lock and keeps
 * retrying to grab the other's. tryLock() is the non-blocking acquire: it
 * returns false immediately instead of waiting, so these are active busy loops,
 * not blocked threads. If they used plain synchronized they would DEADLOCK
 * instead: blocked, not busy.
 *
 * Attempts are capped so the demo ends; uncapped the livelock would spin forever.
 *
 * A ReentrantLock plays the same guard role as a synchronized block but is an
 * explicit object from java.util.concurrent. It offers what synchronized
 * cannot: non-blocking tryLock(), timed lock acquisition, and interruptible
 * waiting. Reentrant means the owning thread may acquire the same lock again
 * without deadlocking on itself. Every lock() must be paired with an
 * unlock(), typically in a finally block — there is no automatic release as
 * with synchronized.
