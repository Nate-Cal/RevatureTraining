/**
 * A race condition, made visible. Ten threads each increment the SAME shared
 * int. count++ is really "read, add one, write back" and is not atomic: two
 * threads can read the same value and write the same result back, which
 * silently drops one increment. The final total comes out below expected.
 *
 * The increment is written as separate read/yield/write steps. The yield just
 * widens the read-modify-write window so another thread can step in between —
 * without it, on a quiet machine the tiny increments can happen to serialize
 * and hide the bug. The race itself is the point: use SynchronizedCounter to
 * see the fix.
