/**
 * The classic Producer-Consumer problem, solved with wait()/notifyAll().
 *
 * Producers add items to a bounded buffer; consumers take items out. Three
 * rules must hold: never add when full (overflow), never remove when empty
 * (underflow), and only one thread touches the buffer at a time (mutual
 * exclusion). Each wait() releases the lock so the other side can run; each
 * notifyAll() wakes whoever is waiting.
 *
 * The notes point out that ArrayBlockingQueue (see ProducerConsumerBlockingQueue)
 * handles all of this safely and is the modern recommendation — this class
 * exists to show the manual mechanics underneath.

    /**
     * A custom bounded buffer that enforces the three producer-consumer rules.
     *
     * Waiting and notifying are handled by hand here. A full producer calls
     * wait(), which releases the monitor lock so a consumer can enter and
     * drain the buffer; wait() returns only after a notifyAll() reacquires
     * the lock. Consumers do the mirror image when the buffer is empty.
     * Every wake path calls notifyAll() so whichever side is blocked gets a
     * chance to run.
     *
     * Every method here is synchronized because wait(), notifyAll(), and the
     * shared fields (items, produced, consumed, productionDone) require safe
     * mutual exclusion. Beyond that, wait() and notifyAll() are only legal
     * while holding the intrinsic lock of the object they are called on, so
     * they cannot appear outside a synchronized block or method.
     *
     * Note the while loops around each wait(): the condition (full or empty)
     * must be re-checked after waking, because a notifyAll() can wake a thread
     * for a reason other than the exact condition it was waiting on.
