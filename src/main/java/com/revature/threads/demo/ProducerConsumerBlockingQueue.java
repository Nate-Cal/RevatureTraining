/**
 * The same Producer-Consumer problem, using ArrayBlockingQueue — the modern,
 * safe approach. The queue itself enforces the rules: put() blocks when the buffer
 * is full (no overflow) and take() blocks when it is empty (no underflow), and all
 * the locking is handled internally. This lets the whole wait()/notifyAll() machinery
 * from ProducerConsumer shrink to two method calls.
 *
 * start() launches a worker thread to run its code in the background, while main
 * keeps going. join() then makes main pause until a specific worker finishes,
 * so main can act only once the work it depends on is done. Here start() lets all
 * four threads run concurrently, the joins on the producers ensure main does not
 * push the sentinels until both are finished, and the joins on the consumers
 * ensure the final printout runs only after all work is complete.
