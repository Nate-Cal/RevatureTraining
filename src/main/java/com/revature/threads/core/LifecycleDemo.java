/**
 * The states a thread moves through, observed at guaranteed moments.
 *
 * A thread is always in exactly one of six states:
 *
 * NEW: constructed but never started.
 * RUNNABLE: running, or eligible to run once the scheduler picks it up.
 * BLOCKED: waiting to acquire a monitor lock held by another thread.
 * WAITING: waiting indefinitely for another thread to act.
 * TIMED_WAITING: waiting for a bounded amount of time.
 * TERMINATED: run() has finished.
 *
 * The exact state immediately after start() is scheduling-dependent: the
 * thread may still be RUNNABLE, or may already have reached TIMED_WAITING by
 * the time we check. The NEW, TIMED_WAITING, and TERMINATED states are the
 * reliable ones to demonstrate.
